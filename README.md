# Simple Net Mask translation

Argv is handled first and then, piped input will be handled.

### Awereness
`mask.{py,sh}` must be on the same folder

### Usage
```./mask.sh```  will show all masks translation (execption of localhost) given by `ifconfig`

### TO DO
- Sum the bits would be a cleaver way to do this
- RegEx is for IPv4 and not for a respective Mask
